Homework 7 Log
--------------

1. 
    hw7.txt
    before beginning the homework, I moved all my lab stuff to a folder called lab7 to avoid confusion

2.
    created a new version of diffutils at version 3.0:
        git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils diffhw
        git checkout v3.0 -b quote

3.
    copied my patch into the diffhw/ directory, then ran "patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt
    everything succeeded! I initially tried to patch without checking out the 3.0 branch, and everything failed.

4 / 5: 
    c-x 4 a opened a new changelog, where I formatted my changelog entry. After writing it, I was ready to commit.

6:
    First I added all my newly modified files to the staging area:
        git add src/cmp.c
        git add src/diff.c
        git add src/diff3.c
        git add src/dir.c 
        git add src/sdiff.c 
        git add src/util.c 

    git commit -m "
            * src/cmp.c: changed all backtik chars in character string constants to single quotes
            * src/diff.c: changed all backtik chars in character string constants to single quotes
            * src/diff3.c: changed all backtik chars in character string constants to single quotes
            * src/dir.c: changed all backtik chars in character string constants to single quotes
            * src/sdiff.c: changed all backtik chars in character string constants to single quotes
            * src/util.c: changed all backtik chars in character string constants to single quotes
    "
    >  6 files changed, 43 insertions(+), 43 deletions(-)

7. 
    I formatted a new quote patch based off version 3.0 by running 
        "git format-patch v3.0"
    then renamed it to "formatted-patch.txt"
    It had 351 lines, which was similar to the length of my previous patch.

8.
    git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils difftest
    git checkout v3.0 -b patchery

    cp ../diffhw/formatted-patch.txt .

    at first, git am did not work properly for me. I needed to remove the .git/rebase-apply directory before it would.
    after removing this directory, I excecuted:

    git am < formatted-patch.txt
    Applying: 2020-02-29 George Benton Owen <classowe@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>

    After that, I built the system:
        ./bootstrap
        ./configure
        make
        make check
    Just like in the lab, all 88 tests passed! It seems as if my system built perfectly.
    running "./src/diff --help" outputs a help page, where ALL ` characters have been changed to '. I love it!
9.
    Running "make distdir" outputs a directory "diffutils-3.0.1-b7a1" containing a version of my code.
        "emacs diffutils-3.0.1-b7a1/ChangLog"

    the changelog contains my entry:

    2020-02-29  George Benton Owen  <classowe@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>
        * src/cmp.c: changed all backtik chars in character string constants to single quotes
        ... <contents listed above> ...

10.

    cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L/

    running "gitk" opens up a gui for browsing the git repository. 
    running "gitk --until=2015-01-25" displays only those commits older than Jan. 25, 2015

    The newest merge older than Jan. 25, 2015 is a merge on that date by Joakim Verona. Here is the commit:

            Author: Joakim Verona <joakim@verona.se>  2015-01-25 12:19:27
            Committer: Joakim Verona <joakim@verona.se>  2015-01-25 12:19:27

            Branches: master, remotes/origin/master and many more (254)

            Precedes: emacs-25.0.90

                Merge branch 'master' into xwidget

    Gitk is pretty cool. The top window shows a list of commits over time, along with a commit history tree to visually represent them.
    Each commit has an author credited, along with a date.
    Clicking on a commit in the top window loads it into the bottom left window, where more information is shown on it. 
    If the commit changed code/files, these changes are listed here in diff files. 
    The bottom right window lists all the files included in the commit, for your browsing convenience. 
    You can look at diff files for each modified file, as well as the entire repository at that point in history.

    This specific merge merged the "master" branch (represented as a red line on the tree) into the xwidget branch (a pink line). 
    This updates the xwidget branch to contain the commits made to "master" since the two were last merged.
