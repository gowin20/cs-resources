strace

Copying file to another
	strace ./tr2b a b < bigfile.txt > Bnewbig.txt
	strace ./tr2u a b < bigfile.txt > Unewbig.txt

Copying a file to stdout
	strace ./tr2b a b < bigfile.txt
	strace ./tr2u a b < bigfile.txt

tr2b uses write commands with much larger buffers! one write command would take the form of write(1, "...", 1024)

tr2u only ever writes one character at a time (and takes MUCH longer as a result)

When we compare the times that these programs take:
	time ./tr2b a b < bigfile.txt > Bnewbig.txt
		real	0m0.111s
		user	0m0.098s
		sys	0m0.012s
	time ./tr2u a b < bigfile.txt > Unewbig.txt
		real	0m19.141s
		user	0m5.516s
		sys	0m13.623s
