Input bugs found in step 5:

	Even though the program explicitly only accepts integer values, it is possible to enter several values that will produce 
	nonsensical or incorrect results. The first and perhaps most obvious of these is negative numbers. The program still accepts them
	and runs properly, but the results are a little silly. For example, if there is a sign difference between the total people surveyed and the
	amount voting for Newson/Cox, the percentage will be a negative number. Really, any introduction of negative integers into the program
	causes confusion and alarm. Entering the total number of people surveyed as zero also causes an error - you're dividing by zero, so the
	percentages both show as 'inf%'.

Logic errors introduced in step 6:

	">" sign changed to "<" on line 30 - an easy mistake to make, that will cause the program to always give a bad/incorrect prediction.

	pctNewson and pctCox calculations on lines 20/21 changed - they're now dividing numberSurveyed by forNewson/forCox, instead of the other way around.
	This causes the percentages to be completely incorrect, as that's not how you calculate percentages. I don't know if this is a "common"
	mistake, but I've certainly done this several times while attempting to write code.

Compiler errors introduced in step 7:

	Semicolon at the end of line 13 removed.
	The simplest and most common compiler error is certainly forgetting to add a semicolon at the end of a statement. This will cause the program to
	fail to compile, and if you don't use debugging software you might be scratching your head for a while looking for your error.

	Closing parentheses on line 30 removed.
	Once again, a semi-common syntactic mistake that will cause the program to fail to compile.
