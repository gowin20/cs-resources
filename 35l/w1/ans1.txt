7. There are 101 total directories modified within the last four weeks in /usr/local/cs
    
    command used: find /usr/local/cs -type d -mtime -28 | wc -l

    First five directories:
      /usr/local/cs
      /usr/local/cs/src/grep
      /usr/local/cs/src/grep/RCS
      /usr/local/cs/share/info
      /usr/local/cs/share/man/man1
  
8. 303 Symbolic links

    C-M-s : (forward) incremental regular expression search
    C-M-t : transpose two balanced expressions
    C-M-u : Move up by parenthesis
    C-M-v : scrolls to the next window

        Definitions found by entering the Emacs manual (C-h r) then searching keywords with C-s

13. C-g cancels out of partially typed commands, and stops in-progress commands, and generally quits/aborts most things
        C-h r to enter manual, then searched though C-s

  14. Yank is basically like paste. It yanks the content of the kill ring buffer and inserts it into the current cursor position. Easily invoked by typing C-y
        no emacs commands used for this, my TA taught me

15. The directory listing of emacs shows hidden files (similar to the ls -a command), while ls -l does not
        Dired also lists the exact time (hours,minutes) associated with the file, while ls -l only does date
