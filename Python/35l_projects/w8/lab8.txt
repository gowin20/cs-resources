    du estimates file space

    du -sk . => 520828 Kb
    du -sk .git => 358316 Kb

    The total space used for the entire git repository is 520828 Kb.
    The space used for working files can be found by subtracting the space used by the '.git' folder
    from the total repository space.
    The disk space used by the working files is 162512 Kb

    It seems as if .git/objects/pack consumes the most space, with a size of 342032 Kb. This makes it by far the largest file in the repository.


2.
    I piped each command to "wc -l" to get a count o them
    
    "git branch --list" gives locals : there are 176

    "git branch -r" gives remote : there are 177
    (to get the number, I piped each command to wc -l)


3.
    git remote -v shows me that there's one repository that is remote to this one.

    the repository's name is "origin", and it's found at this URL: https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git
    It's listed as two repositories, as it is both the location that this repository fetches changes from and pushes changes to.

	git for-each-ref iterates over all the references, and outputs information on each. We pipe it the list of all the branches to get information on them.

	git branch --list | git for-each-ref --count=10 --sort=committerdate refs/heads

	git rev-list master | wc -l

	There are 139,583 commits in the master branch. That's quite a bit!

6.
	git rev-list --all | wc -l
	
	There are 143,910 commits in total. 
	Comparing that number to the number of the previous question, we see that 139583/143910 , or about 97% of all commits are in the master branch.
7.
	"git shortlog" summarizes the output of "git log". I used this command to find the information necessary

		git shortlog --after="2012-12-31" -n -s

	"-n" sorts by number of commits per author
	"-s" further shortens the output by omitting commit messages

	Top 10 from this list:
		3691  Eli Zaretskii
		3647  Glenn Morris
		3605  Paul Eggert
		1806  Lars Ingebrigtsen
		1784  Stefan Monnier
		1571  Michael Albinus
		619  Dmitry Gutov
		576  Noam Postavsky
		471  Alan Mackenzie
		469  Juri Linkov

	At first, I wanted to write a bash script to answe this.
	I created a new file which contained the list of target hashes, and called it "targets"	
	However, as I started to write it I realzied that it would be much faster to just find the commits manually (sadly this is also way less cool)

	So, I used "git log --merges > ~/merges" to get a list of all the merge commits

	Then, I used emacs pattern matching to find which commits were merges.

	Not found / Not Immediately within a merge:
