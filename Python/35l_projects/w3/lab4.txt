	./configure --prefix=/u/eng/class/clasowe/35l/bCoreutils
		using --prefix configures the coreutils package to install
		 in the specified folder, instead of in /usr/bin
	make
		This command compiles and maintains all the 
		code found within coreutils
	make install
		After running make, make install will actually install 
		the package within the folder I specified


Building this caused an error:
	In file included from utimecmp.c:41:
	utimens.h:2:5: error: conflicting types for 'futimens'
	    2 | int futimens (int, char const *, struct timespec const [2]);
	      |     ^~~~~~~~
	In file included from utimecmp.h:25,
	                 from utimecmp.c:25:
	/usr/include/sys/stat.h:373:12: note: previous declaration of 'futimens' was here
	  373 | extern int futimens (int __fd, const struct timespec __times[2]) __THROW;
	      |            ^~~~~~~~

I downloaded the patch using
	wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter20/cs35L/assign/coreutils.diff
then applied it with
	patch -p0 < coreutils.diff

after that, I was able to sucessfully build coreutils.


Then I reproduced the problem by creating an "old" file

	touch -d '1912-11-11 11:00 GMT' titanic-logs

	touch now
	sleep 1
	touch now1

	TZ=UTC0 ls -lt --full-time titanic-logs now now1
	-rw-r--r-- 1 classowe class 0 2048-12-17 17:28:16.000000000 +0000 titanic-logs
	-rw-r--r-- 1 classowe class 0 2020-02-03 07:48:46.442793000 +0000 now1
	-rw-r--r-- 1 classowe class 0 2020-02-03 07:48:39.939753000 +0000 now
