Q1:
	Our patch to ls makes the performance of the script negligibly worse.
	Since more lines of code are executed, running the script takes longer
		time ls
	gives 0.002 seconds, while
		time ./coreutils-8.29/src/ls
	gives 0.002 seconds as well. It doesn't drastically change runtime.

Q2:
	This patch should not cause additional issues 
	for the vast majority of the time.
	However, if users write a shell script that uses ls -aA, 
	and that script requires the current and top-level directories
	to be listed, then that will be an issue. 
	Just be smart about usage and it should be fine.
	
Q3:
	When the randline script is invoked on an empty file, it throws 
	an error "list index out of range"
	this is because there are no lines to read from.

Q4:
	When the randline script is invoked using python3, 
	it gives a syntax error.
	Python3 changed the syntax of things such as exception statements. 
	This means we need to say something like
		except IOError as err:
			(errno, strerror) = err.args
	instead of
		except IOError as (errno, strerror)

Q5:
	When running my shuf.py code in Python2, 
	most functionality is preserved.
	Specifically, all of the options and arguments work 
	except for the ones that read from stdin.
	Calling the function without any arguments, 
	or with a single '-' argument produces an error,
	as the input() command is not compatible with Python2
